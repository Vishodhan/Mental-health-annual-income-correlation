## **Depression vs GDP Analysis**

Mental health disorders like depression and anxiety can hamper the overall productivity and mental wellbeing of a person in the long run. Such disorders can affect work productivity and in turn the GDP of a country.
This project aims to understand and discover the correlation between number of people suffering from depression and its impact and effect on the overall GDP of a country. 
The objective is to visualize how these parameters are related for different countries (India, USA, U.A.E, Australia) and try to predict the depression count in a country based on the GDP using Linear regression and polynomial regression algorithms.
The outcome of the project is the discovery of the sparsity of the data which lead to poor model performance.
However, with the correlation as the main aim of the project, we were able to visualize and understand how these factors affect each other.
